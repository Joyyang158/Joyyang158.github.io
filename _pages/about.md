I am a second-year Master's student at the [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu). My research interests are focused on Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically in the following four areas:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Reliability and Trustworthiness of LLMs
- Advanced Post-Training and Alignment Methods
- Efficient Fine-Tuning

**I am actively seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2025**. You are welcome to explore my [publications](publications/), [professional experience](teaching/), and [CV](assets/CV_HaoyanYang.pdf) for further details on my work and research.
