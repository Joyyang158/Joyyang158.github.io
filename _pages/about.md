I am a second-year Master's student at the [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu). My research focuses on enhancing the reliability of large language models (LLMs), addressing issues such as hallucinations, privacy leakage, and overconfidence. Additionally, I am interested in better fine-tuning and alignment methods to improve LLM performance and reliability. Speeding up inference to enhance LLM efficiency is also one of my research interests.

You are welcome to explore my [publications](publications/), [professional experience](teaching/), and [CV](assets/CV_HaoyanYang.pdf) for further details on my work and research.
